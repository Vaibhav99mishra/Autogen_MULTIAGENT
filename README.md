# **Collaborative Multi-Agent Architecture Design Tool**

## **Overview**
This repository provides a collaborative **multi-agent architecture design tool** that simulates the interactions between different architectural roles to generate optimized solutions for complex business requirements. It utilizes **cloud-native services**, **open-source frameworks**, and a **collaborative decision-making process** to deliver a robust architecture tailored to the business needs.

The tool supports:
- Cloud-based solutions (Azure, AWS, GCP).
- Open-source on-premises solutions.
- Mediated reviews and recommendations by a lead architect.

## **Key Features**
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**:
  - **Cloud Architect Agent**: Provides solutions leveraging cloud provider services.
  - **OSS Architect Agent**: Proposes open-source, on-premises solutions.
  - **Lead Architect Agent**: Reviews, critiques, and finalizes the best solution.

- **Dynamic Problem Solving**:
  - Agents collaborate using structured **chain-of-thought reasoning**.
  - Solutions are aligned with best practices in scalability, disaster recovery, and cost optimization.

- **Extensive Comparison**:
  - Solutions include **tables summarizing proposals** for easy understanding and decision-making.
  - The tool highlights **advantages** and **disadvantages** of cloud vs. open-source solutions.

- **Automated Simulation**:
  - Uses a **state machine** to manage interactions between agents.
  - Simulates real-world team discussions, making it an effective training tool.

## **Setup Instructions**
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_folder>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure Python 3.10+ is installed. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pyautogen groq openai
   ```

3. **Set Up API Keys**:
   - For **Groq API**:
     - Add your `groq_api_key` to the environment:
       ```python
       from google.colab import userdata
       api_key = userdata.get('groq_api_key')
       ```

   - For **OpenAI API**:
     - Replace `"your-openai-api-key"` in the code with your OpenAI API key.

4. **Run the Simulation**:
   Execute the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## **How It Works**
1. **Business Requirements**:
   - Data storage for massive IoT data.
   - Real-time data analytics and machine learning pipeline.
   - Scalability, cost optimization, and disaster recovery in Europe.
   - Tools for monitoring and observability.

2. **Agents**:
   - **Cloud Architect**: Proposes cloud-native solutions using Azure, AWS, and GCP.
   - **OSS Architect**: Suggests open-source frameworks like Apache Cassandra, Flink, and Spark.
   - **Lead Architect**: Reviews both proposals, critiques them, and makes a final recommendation.

3. **Simulated Workflow**:
   - Agents respond in sequence based on predefined **prompts**.
   - Each agent generates architecture proposals for their specific expertise.
   - The **Lead Architect** evaluates all solutions and provides the best recommendation.

4. **Output**:
   - Detailed solutions for **cloud** and **open-source** approaches.
   - Advantages and disadvantages of each solution.
   - Final recommendation by the lead architect.
